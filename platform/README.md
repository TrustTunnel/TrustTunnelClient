# <p align="center">TrustTunnel CLI Client</p>

Here you can find the adapters for Android, Apple and Windows.

These adapters are designed to help integrate TrustTunnel Client Libraries into applications written in a native platform code.

For example, these adapters are used in a [Flutter-based TrustTunnel GUI client](https://github.com/TrustTunnel/TrustTunnelFlutterClient)

In a `testapp` directory you can find a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the adapters could be integrated.
